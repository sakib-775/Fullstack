        <h1>Easy Brownie Recipe</h1>

        <p1>
            We need to talk about these super easy chocolate brownies! They only require 6 ingredients. These are fudgy, dense, thick, and so. darn. chocolatey! We're using simple ingredients and ditching box mixes. These brownies will be on repeat for the whole month of April. And long after, no doubt.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Dark chocolate</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Caster sugar</li>
            <li>Plain Flour</li>
            <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
            <li>Butter (salted or unsalted, both work)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p2>Follow each step carfeully:</p2>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Get yourself 3 bowls
                <ul>
                    <li>In bowl 1 (a medium bowl that fits snugly over a pan) place the butter and chocolate.</li>
                    <li>For bowl 2 (a small bowl) whisk the plain flour and cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>Then, in bowl 3 (a large bowl) place the eggs and sugar</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Place bowl 1 (the butter and chocolate over a pan of simmering water. Let the chocolate and butter melt together and whisk well so that they are fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>While the chocolate and butter are melting, use an electric hand whisk to whip the eggs and sugar. This will take a good few minutes. We want the eggs and sugar mixture to be almost as thick as mayonnaise.</li>
            <li>Once the eggs and sugar are whipped and the chocolate is melted, slowly pour the chocolate into the egg mixture and whisk (not an electric whisk a regular one) to blend together. Add the flour and cocoa to the bowl and whisk again.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture (you may need to spoon it in. It'll be <b>Thick!</b>) into a 9x9 (23cm) square tin lined with baking paper. Bake in a 160ÂºC oven for about 30 minutes. The top should feel (and look set) but the brownies should still wobble slightly when you wiggle the pan.</li>
            <li>Let the brownies cool completely before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
